HELLO !
My name is Vahid Taghizadeh.
Basically, I'm just a male human being,

I'M A FRONT-END DEVELOPER
I'm fluent with javascript and laravel.
I also know how to translate these languages in LESS, Sass, Compass & Coffee.
and had a lot of experience in large scale applications development in front-end with MV* frameworks such a backbonejs and angular.js. 

I'm always looking to improve my development skills specially about javascript and designing. I often find myself concepting and designing layouts so that I have the opportunity to experiment with it in development. I love the dynamic landscape of the web, and am always captivated with the immensely creative ways in which designers and developers are shaping it.
